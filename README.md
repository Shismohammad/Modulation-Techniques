# Modulation Techniques using MATLAB GUI

#### Introduction:

Welcome to the Git repository for my undergraduate mini-project, Modulation Techniques using MATLAB GUI! This repository serves as a central hub for all the code, documentation, and resources related to the project, which aims to demonstrate how analog and digital modulation techniques work using a MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI). The purpose of this introduction is to provide an overview of the project and guide you through the contents and structure of this repository.

#### Project Overview:

The Modulation Techniques project focuses on providing a visual and interactive platform to understand the principles and applications of analog and digital modulation techniques. By leveraging the power of MATLAB and creating a user-friendly GUI, this project aims to demonstrate the process of modulating and demodulating signals, helping users comprehend the fundamental concepts behind various modulation schemes. The project encompasses digital modulation techniques (such as Amplitude Shift Keying, Frequency Shift Keying, and Phase Shift Keying).
